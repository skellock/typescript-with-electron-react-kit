# electron-starter

This is a electron starter kit from some random guy on the Internet.


### Why?

I've got dozens of Electron apps started and not finished. They die before they can leave the bikeshed.

This is my attempt to fix that.


### Why Not?

Oh man... lots of reasons. There's other starter ones out there. That use things like WebPack, Babel, Flow, and Redux.

This pack o' tools is slightly off the main stream. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not full on hipster, but does have hipster-like tendencies. It's not as far as say, `reason`, `elm`, or `purescript`. I'm not that crazy or brave yet.

The tools in this pack do **less**. They have less config. Less API. Less plugins.

I need more **less** in my life.


### License

MIT. A tip of the hat is always nice, but I'm more interested in hearing what you do with it.
